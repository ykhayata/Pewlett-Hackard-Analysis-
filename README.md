# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of my analysis is to examine the employees at Pewlett Hackard, and analyze the aging workforce. I have been told to identify employees who are on the verge of retirement, and see if we can fit them into a part time mentorship program, rather than forcing them to retire.

## Results

### Major Takeaways 

1: 90,396 employees are on the verge of retirement 
2: 64% of these retiring employees are senior level 
3: 43,636 employees are engineers
4: 2 managers need to be replaced
5: 40,497 employees are staff

### Mentorship Program

As you can see, none of these employees have any termination dates, which would make them elgible for the mentorship program. There are 1,550 employees elgible for this program, 48% are at the Senior Level, and 48% are engineers. 

## Summary 

When we look at our analysis, we see there are 90,396 potential vacancies that need to be filled because of retirement. If analyze even further, we see that there are only 1,550 employees that are qualified to mentor new employees. Another thing to look at is that there is only 741 senior level employees eligible to handle 57,668 vacancies. Clearly, we have a shortage here. 

We must change the criteria to the mentorship program to bridge the gap between mentors and vacancies. For example, if we change to criteria for the mentorship program to employees born between 1962 and 1965, we see that there is one mentor for every 1.6 employees, and one senior mentor for every 2.3 new senior level employees. This way, we can decrease the amount of employees per mentor, and thus improve the mentorship program.
